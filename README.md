# HAR-Human_Acitivity_Recognition-
Human Activity Recognition is the problem of predicting what a person is doing based on movement tracing using sensors. The main objective of the project is to built an optimum Deep Learning model that predicts the following human activities such as walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing or laying.
Human Activity Recognition is mainly be used for elderly care and health care as an assistive technology. The data is recorded with the help of sensors (Accelerometer and Gyroscope) present in the smartphones. We have that an Accelerometer which is used to detect the orientation of the mobile where as Gyroscope adds an additional dimension to the information supplied by the accelerometer by tracking rotation or twist.
We will apply different Deep learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Reinforcement Learning, Recurrent Neural Networks to find an optimum deep learning algorithm to recognize human activities.
